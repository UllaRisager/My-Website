    <h1>Conversations in Cuba</h1>
    <h1>If you don't take that chance you will never be free</h1>
    <p>You know, Ulla I’ve lost everything – twice, but I got back up. Money comes and goes, but I always get back up and that’s my strength. I can do this now, right here in Cuba, because I know myself, I have the strength inside me – and you have to be ready for that, you have to know deep down inside yourself that you have the strength to do this – to be broke, to lose money and get back up, this is the only way you will be completely free, if you don’t take that chance, you will never be free.

 I was out of words.

I thought to myself, this is the meaning of life, this, right here, this conversation we’re having in half Spanish, half Italian. I am so damn lucky to have met this person and the only person I can thank is myself for being curious, open minded and adventurous about life. Had I never learned Italian, living in Italy and Switzerland, we wouldn’t be having this conversation in half Italian. Had I never learned Spanish living in a small town in Andalucía Spain, I wouldn’t be able to have this conversation at all and I would have missed out on so many other beautiful conversations.

If you never take chances or risk being vulnerable or broke or what not, putting yourself out there, you miss out on life. It doesn’t matter what you do, just do something.

So go out there and take that chance.</p>

    <h2>Why We Travel</h2>
      <h1>A Journey of Inner Transformation</h1>
    <p>Alain de Botton, renowned Author, Philosopher and founder of ‘The School of Life’ said that: “A journey is a process of feeling and inner transformation . Travel is a psychological experience and the psychological ingredient of happiness is why we travel – and travel, culture and art exist in the people we meet, so we need to be the creator of the ingredient and make life into a life of art!”

When you’re traveling you’re moving, but you also want to be moved! What is it that we are really searching for? And what is it that we hope to change?

I have often asked myself why I always travel and for so many years, I’ve been telling myself that I am just restless and that’s why I travel, but thinking about Botton’s words: “Traveling has ambition to change something in the inner world”  – I know exactly why I’m traveling and it essentially all comes down to three things:

Connection
Growth
Meaning
